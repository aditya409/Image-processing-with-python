We are assuming that an environment file(.yml) is already present with all the required libraries. We want to use that environment.
steps are as follow:
1. Open the command prompt.
2. Naviagte to the location of environment file using change directory (CD) command.
3. Once you are in right location we need to create an environemnt using the .yml file.
4. Start typing> conda env create -f your_env_file.yml (it will download all the libraries and other things)
5. After completion of the download we need to activate the environment.
6. Start typing> conda activate  your downloaded file name.
7. After activation of the environment  we need IDE to work
8. We will proceeds with Jupyter lab
9. start Typing conda> jupyter-lab
